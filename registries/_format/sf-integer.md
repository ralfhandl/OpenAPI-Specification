{% capture summary %}
The `{{page.slug}}` format represents a structured fields integer as defined in [RFC8941].

```abnf
sf-integer = ["-"] 1*15DIGIT
```

Integers have a range of -999,999,999,999,999 to 999,999,999,999,999 inclusive (i.e., up to fifteen digits, signed),
for IEEE 754 compatibility [IEEE754].

This format is appropriate for a header value that must conform to the {{page.slug}} structured field definition.
